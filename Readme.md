# GliGli's VinylScan

The goal of this project is to be able to play audio from scans of a vinyl (made using a >= 2400 DPI flatbed scanner).
This project has two parts:
- One to aggregate and correlate many scans of a single vinyl side, to get a sharp and clear picture of all the groove angles.
- One to extract a .WAV track from a vinyl aggregated picture.

The project is in **Beta stage** and located at: <https://github.com/gligli/VinylScan>.
